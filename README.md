# Documentation Decisions taken

**React** was chosen for this project for its ability to be fast, scalable, and simple.
<br/>
**React-router** was preferred in this project because it allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates.
<br/>
**Bootstrap** was chosen for this project because it able me to quickly create features using predefined classes and design templates that are provided by bootstrap.
